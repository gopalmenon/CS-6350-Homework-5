\section{Kernels}
\label{sec:q2}

\begin{enumerate}  


\item  ~[15 points] If $K_1(\bx,\bz)$ and $K_2(\bx,\bz)$ are both valid kernel
  functions. In this question, you will prove that certain functions
  of kernels are valid kernels. 

  [Hint: For both the proofs below, use the the definition of a kernel
  as a dot product in a high dimensional space.]

\begin{enumerate}
\item ~[5 points] Show that the product of two kernels is a kernel.
  That is, show that $K$ in the expression below is a kernel:
  \begin{equation*}
    K(\bx,\bz) = K_1(\bx,\bz) K_2(\bx,\bz)
  \end{equation*} 

\item ~[10 points] Show that a polynomial over a kernel that is
  constructed using positive coefficients is a kernel. That is, if $P$
  is any polynomial with positive coefficients, show that $K$ below is
  a kernel:
  \begin{equation*}
    K(\bx,\bz) =P( K_1(\bx,\bz))
  \end{equation*} 
Hint: You may need show  $ K(\bx,\bz) = \alpha K_1(\bx,\bz) +  \beta K_2(\bx,\bz)$ is a valid kernel and use the conclusion in the previous question.
\end{enumerate} 
  

\item~[10 points] Given two examples $\bx \in \Re^2$ and $\bz \in
  \Re^2$, let
  \begin{equation}
    K(\bx,\bz) = 15\left(\bx^T\bz\right)^2 \exp\left(-||\bx - \bz||^2\right)
  \end{equation}
  Prove that this is a valid kernel function.
  
 \item ~(\textbf{For 6350 students})[10 points]An valid kernel can always be  expressed as inner product. Prove that the Gaussian  kernel

$$K(\bx, \bz) = \exp(\frac{-\| x -z\|^2}{2 \sigma^2})$$
 can be written down as the inner product of an feature space with infinite dimension. Hint:  You may do some expansion and  then show the middle factor can be expanded as a power series.
